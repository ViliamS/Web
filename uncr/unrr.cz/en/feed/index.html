								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The third Czech Fiscal Council Report on the Long-Term Sustainability of Public Finances was produced in the shadow of the coronavirus pandemic. By affecting the change in the medium-term projection, the pandemic pointed to insufficient resilience of public finances to withstand shocks of a similar nature. Recent fiscal policy has been highly procyclical, and the use of massive expansionary policy in 2018 and 2019 despite favourable economic developments has drained the government’s resources to stimulate the economy in bad times. Due to discretionary measures, the public sector’s finances will operate with a large deficit in the coming years. This will contribute to a significant increase in general government debt.</p>



<p>Although from the long-run perspective it is usually essential to disregard the business cycle and temporary effects, the impact of the pandemic is so significant that we have included it in our government debt projection. But this is not the only reason why the debt projection is significantly higher than it was a year ago. Among other things, an increase in pensions beyond the valorisation scheme introduced at the beginning of 2020 will affect the expenditures of the pension system for several years ahead.</p>



<p>The projection of public sector revenues and expenditures rests on two basic assumptions. First, similarly to the previous report, it is based on real convergence of the Czech economy, characterised by labour productivity growth and an increasing share of wages in the economy. The second key parameter is the updated demographic projection, which reveals a slightly more favourable path, mainly due to a higher migration balance. However, the Czech population continues to age. Should no fundamental changes in the pension system occur, the share of retirement pensions in GDP will increase from the current 7.5% to 12% over the next 40 years. The next generation to draw a pension will not only be larger, but will also live longer. This will affect the pension system significantly. However, the demographic changes will affect other areas of public finances, most of all health care, education and the cash benefits system. Economic growth, which will be reflected in higher wages and consequently higher income tax revenues and social security contributions, will not be enough to offset the higher expenditures.</p>



<p>In terms of assessing the sustainability of public finances, the situation has deteriorated significantly compared to last year. If the current tax and expenditure policies are maintained, the “debt brake” threshold, which is legally set at 55% of GDP, will be breached as early as 2043. This is four years earlier than we anticipated in the 2019 projection. Before the pandemic shock we counted on a positive primary balance of the public sector in the coming years, whereas the government’s past fiscal policy and the economic impact of the pandemic will result in the primary balance turning negative right at the beginning of our projection. Subsequent demographic developments, resulting in baby-boom cohorts retiring, will significantly widen the public deficit to 7.5% of GDP.</p>



<p>Under these conditions, the projected government debt will reach 298% of GDP at the end of the 50-year horizon, significantly higher than in the previous projection. This is not only because of unfavourable initial conditions and increasing costs resulting from demographic trends, but also due to rising interest rates in response to higher indebtedness of the economy. At the same time, interest rates on government debt rise earlier because the debt brake will be breached earlier. Even if the financial markets were not to react to the growing indebtedness and the interest rate was kept at zero, the accumulated government debt would approach 160% of GDP. But for the government debt to be no higher than the debt brake threshold in fifty years’ time, the public balance would have to improve by 3.28% of GDP in each year of the projection. Recall that last year we reported this indicator as being half a percentage point lower.</p>



<p>Being aware of the uncertainty associated with our baseline scenario, we have calculated several alternative scenarios. However, neither the incorporation of the positive effects of digitisation and robotics, nor more favourable demographic trends solve the problem of the long-term sustainability of public finances. Even when we consider a rather unrealistic scenario with high fertility at the 1970s level, the pension system deficits remain very large. Despite some improvement, the problem persists even when the retirement age is linked to life expectancy.</p>



<p>The increase in projected debt in the simulated period suggests that the system is in a long-term imbalance. Correcting this imbalance requires more than merely cosmetic changes. A quick response is needed to solve the problem. The remaining time for legislators to adjust tax and spending policies before the country’s debt reaches the debt brake threshold is shortening quickly. The later these changes are made, the more painful they will be. It is thus in the interests of all of society that a debate leading to specific measures be launched as soon as possible. </p>

<p>Pursuant to Act No.  23/2017 Coll., on budgetary responsibility rules, Section 21(2)(a), the Czech Fiscal Council monitors the development of public sector finance.  Within the framework of that task, it also strives to identify risks and threats that may have an adverse impact on public budget stability in the short-term, medium-term, and long-term.  Since September 2018, the Czech Fiscal Council regularly, on a quarterly basis, has informed the public about its conclusions.</p>



<p><strong>Macroeconomic background </strong><br>The performance of the Czech economy in Q1 of this year was only in part influenced by the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic.  GDP declined by 2% year on year, in particular due to the weakening of exports and investments, whereas household consumption stagnated.  Development in the second half of the year will depend not only on the restart of the economy after the loosening of domestic measures stifling economic activity, but, above all, on the development of demand for Czech exports by our main trading partners.</p>



<p>At this point, relevant data is not yet available about the development of the economy in April and May, with the exception of indicators of confidence and data about the state budget.  In April, confidence indicators noted a strong adverse impact, in terms of both entrepreneurs and consumers.  Consumer sentiments improved in May, but entrepreneurs remain sceptical.  Compared to the results of the April survey, consumers were less concerned about a worsening of the overall economic situation, their own financial situation, or an unemployment rise in the next twelve months.  With a view to the development of current inflation, however, their fears of price hikes were up significantly.</p>



<p>Expectations among industrial firms, concerning future developments of the economic situation for the next three months, remain pessimistic, whereas, compared to April, they are more optimistic when it comes to the period of the next six months.  A positive May outcome of the survey in the industrial sector is the expected development of exports in the next three months: whereas in April, nearly 40% of industrialists had expected a drop in exports, in May only 28% did.  Among other things, the exchange rate of the Czech crown to the euro developed in favour of exporters, with the country’s currency weakening significantly in comparison to the time prior to the arrival of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Neither the weaker currency exchange rate nor the drop in CNB basic 2W repo rates to 0.25% can do much to help reverse the drop in foreign demand, given the current circumstances.  Approximately one-quarter of industrialists are planning layoffs at this point, with 11.6% of them reporting financial problems related to solvency, like in 2019. </p>



<p>Scepticism persists in certain service sectors, in particular due to a combination of the impact of restrictive measures and the overall change in outlooks related, above all, to tourism and the tourist sector. </p>



<p><br><strong>Public sector finances and the set-up of fiscal and budgetary policy for the future of coming years</strong> <br>Major restrictive measures against the spread of the Covid-19 disease, which paralysed the economy, naturally involved a drop in public budget income and an increase in certain expenditures.  Furthermore, a number of measures were adopted to help stabilise the economic situation of affected companies.  All that resulted in a dramatic worsening of the government budget balance.  At the end of May 2020, the deficit net of the impact of operations involving the EU was nearly CZK 164 bn.  In the previous month, the deficit amounted to CZK 89 bn.  In May, the greatest year-on-year drop in budgetary income (by 14.4%) was noted on the collection of personal income tax from dependent activity.  One of the reasons is the payment of a compensation bonus that is administered as a refund of this tax.  The drops in other fiscally significant taxes were lower (e.g., corporate income tax by -11.1%, VAT -6.9%), collection of social security contributions stagnated year-on-year.  The expense side was burdened, aside from originally planned expenditures, by the first payments from the Antivirus programme and expenditures on the purchase of medical devices.</p>



<p>The Czech Fiscal Council is of the opinion that, in the present situation, government assistance to affected economic entities is necessary, even at the price of a significant increase in the public budget deficit.  The Czech Republic is, fortunately, entering this period in a relatively comfortable position in terms of public debt, which as a share of GDP amounted to 30.8% at the end of 2019, whereas the EU average was 79.3%.  In the case of the structural balance, the fiscal room for response was, unfortunately, significantly reduced by a pro-cyclical fiscal policy of the government in 2018 and 2019, when the government applied expansive fiscal policy at a time of very good economic growth, which resulted in a worsening of the structural balance by 1.9 p.p. (from 0.9% GDP in 2017 to -1% GDP in 2019).</p>



<p>The overall balance of public sector finance in 2020 will depend on the extent and duration of stabilisation measures and also on the overall GDP drop, which can now be estimated only in rough terms.  If the economy drops by 5.6% this year, as the MF expects in its April prediction, and if the existing scope of stabilisation measures were not increased any further, the public sector deficit would, according to CFC calculations, amount to CZK 304 bn, which would correspond to 5.5% of GDP.  If the prediction of the International Monetary Fund were fulfilled, which expects a drop of the Czech economy by 6.5% in 2020, the public sector deficit would deepen to 5.9% of GDP.</p>



<p>According to the CFC, however, the necessary loosening of public finance should only be temporary, and a stabilisation stage should be followed by a return to a sustainable trajectory.  For that reason, the CFC is of the opinion that the loosening of the structural balance limits through to 2027 (approved as a part of the amendment of the Act on Budgetary Responsibility Rules) is not only desirable, but necessary.  According to CFC calculations, public sector debt will reach 44% of GDP by 2025, assuming that the year-on-year drop in the economy this year will amount to 5.6% and that the government will make use of the entire fiscal space provided by the amendment of the Act on Budgetary Responsibility Rules in upcoming years.</p>



<p>In terms of the effectiveness of the measures adopted in support of the economy, prevailing lack of flexibility in certain parts of public administration is, unfortunately, becoming manifest, which is, among other things, evident in the inappropriately set up system of applications in which applicants frequently err, and the slow speed of their processing.</p>



<p>Of the measures being implemented at this point, the CFC draws attention to the adverse impact of the compensation bonus, on municipal and regional budgets.  The possibility of a retroactive application of a loss against income tax, which has already been approved by the Chamber of Deputies, would also have an adverse impact on the budgets of territorial self-governing units.  This sector of public budgets has been, up to this point, very stable, and it would not be good to lose that advantage. Budgets of local government units have already been severely stricken by the cyclical outage of public budgets and any further reduction may have a very adverse impact on their investment activity, which can be considered very important in terms of scope, given that, in recent years, investments by local government units amounted to nearly one-half of all public investments.  The CFC is therefore of the opinion that local budgets should be compensated for such a massive additional outage in income, by a transfer from the state budget, in the form of non-specific subsidies.  If the outage were addressed by subsidy programmes linked to specific projects, the result would be an increase in administrative costs and delays, which could contribute to pro-cyclic behaviour of public investments and hence to a deepening of economic drop.  Furthermore, the fiscal autonomy of local local government units would be restricted.</p>



<p>As concerns the change in income tax mentioned earlier, consisting of the possibility of a retroactive application of a tax loss, the CFC notes that this is an instrument with a potentially very significant impact on public budgets.  Its effectiveness in terms of maintaining employment and stabilising companies is very low compared to existing tools; additionally, tax legislation would become even more complicated as a result.  If this measure is indeed adopted, it will be absolutely key to put a ceiling on the maximum level of retroactively claimed loss.  If this were not done, there would be a realistic threat that companies owned by foreign entities would tend to move their tax losses to the Czech Republic as a tax optimisation measure.  Furthermore, it is generally appropriate for public budget assistance to be predominantly targeted towards small and medium-sized businesses which can be expected to have lesser financial reserves that large corporations. </p>



<p>The CFC is also of the opinion that, at present, when various measures for the stabilisation of the economy are being introduced and continue to be adapted, and when there is insufficient room for discussion about other measures, steps should not be taken that are not entirely connected to the coronavirus crisis and that have a potentially significant impact on public finance transparency and sustainability.  In the former case, it is, for example, an amendment of the Public Procurement Act, where the government proposes several adaptations aiming to reduce transparency of negotiated procedure with publication and the doing away with the obligation to set up an evaluation committee for significant contracts.  The CFC is of the opinion that especially in the case of negotiated procedure with publication, at least the existing minimalist procedural requirements must be retained, as it is a non-competition method with a high risk of inefficiency.  Expenditures on contracts awarded through this method by public contracting entities range between CZK 12 and 20 bn per year. </p>



<p>As for measures that may influence public sector sustainability in the future, they currently include, for example, the method of financing of the construction of additional blocks of the Dukovany power plant.  Given the scope of its powers, the CFC is not about to join the debate of the Czech Republic’s energy mixture; nevertheless, it deems it important to discuss the aspects thereof that have a major impact on public budgets.  In May 2020, the Government presented a proposal for the provision of a loan to ČEZ, covering up to 70% of the funding required for the completion of the Dukovany power plant, with the project costs amounting to approximately CZK 160 bn.  It is evident that the state would have to secure an amount like that in capital markets, which would result of increasing public debt as a share of GDP, an indicator of the debt rule of the Act on Budgetary Responsibility Rules.  Furthermore, experience from the construction of nuclear power plants abroad in recent years have shown that budgeted amounts are regularly significantly exceeded.  The fiscal costs of the completion of the power plant may in the end be significantly higher than present estimates show.  Hence, the CFC is of the opinion that decisions of similar importance should be made subject to careful analysis and detailed discussion.</p>



<p>Given the gradual improvement of the epidemiological situation and return of the economy to normal, the CFC is also of the opinion that the discussion should be renewed of the regulation of the main expense areas that will be under major pressure in connection with changes in demographic structure.  These include, above all, the pension and long-term care systems. </p>

<p>The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus causing the disease called COVID-19 entails economic consequences for the economy of the Czech Republic that have been made worse by government measures designed to counter the spread of the virus. The expected economic collapse of the Czech economy is historically unprecedented and exceeds the impacts of the global financial crisis of 2009 and the European debt crisis of 2013. </p>



<p>The complications for the Czech Republic’s very open economy are a combination of internal shock, related to closure of some premises and halting of production, and external shock, related to interference with global suppliercustomer chains and a massive fall in foreign demand.  There are also threats in the form of a collapse on the labour market, an escalation of financial imbalances, an increase in the number of bankruptcies of non-financial companies, and defaults on loans by companies and households.  In response to these threats, the government adopted a number of measures that were inspired by similar measures abroad.</p>



<p>In order to quantify the impact of the fall in economic activity and the adoption of economic measures on public budget deficits, the Office of the Czech Fiscal Council released a <a href="https://unrr.cz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/20200430_Fiscal-Costs-of-the-COVID-19-Pandemic-in-the-Czech-Republic_arch.pdf">study about Fiscal Costs of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Czech Republic</a>.  Given the dynamic developments brought about by the “coronavirus” crisis, regular updates of the impact of newly adopted measures on the economic balance and projections of public institutions sector debt were required. Therefore the OCFC released <a href="https://unrr.cz/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Updated-estimate-of-the-consequences-of-COVID-19.pdf">updated estimate of the consequences of COVID-19</a> for the economic balance and development of public institutions sector debt – describing the situation as at 5 May 2020. The update shows that the deficit of the Czech Fiscal Council could reach more than CZK 300 billion in 2020.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>At its extraordinary meeting of 1 April 2020, the Government of the Czech Republic approved a bill amending Act No. 23/2017 Coll., on budgetary responsibility rules (hereinafter referred to as the “Act”).  The substance of the proposal is a dramatic increase of the maximum admissible structural deficit values for 2021-2027, from 1% of GDP stated in the applicable text of the Act.  Specifically, the maximum permissible structural deficit value proposed for 2021 is 4% and, in subsequent years, the structural balance is to be improved by at least 0.5 percentage points.  The explanatory memorandum for the government bill states that, if this regulation is not approved, the government would have to set fiscal policy in 2021 very restrictively, in the event of the sharp drop of the economy in 2020 that is currently envisaged.  That would, according to the explanatory memorandum, most likely result in a recession. </p>



<p>The CFC agrees that the present situation requires extraordinary measures, in terms of both the scope and speed of their enactment.  It also understands that some of those measures, and probably also a certain measure of fiscal stimulation of the economy, will be required in the subsequent year.  Nevertheless, the applicable version of the Act does not, in this case, limit the fiscal room given to the government with its 1% limit on the structural balance.  This is due to several institutes that the Act contains and that allow fiscal policy to adequately respond to extraordinary situations linked to major economic problems, without it being bound by the 1% limit.</p>



<p>First and foremost, we must mention the institute of one-off and temporary measures that are taken into account in the setting of expense frameworks.  This means that, if the government needs to stabilise the economy in a specific (limited) time-period by reducing income (e.g., premium reductions) or by increasing expenditures (e.g., a time-limited benefit programme for self-employed people), it can exceed the maximum value of structural balance set by the Act, by the expected scope of those measures.  The same applies to the application of so-called salvage measures.  These include, for example, costs incurred due to a state of emergency or expenditures related to an expected significant worsening of economic developments.</p>



<p>According to the Czech Fiscal Council, anchoring the maximum structural deficit value for 2021 at 4% is excessive, because even the applicable text of the Act, as well as methodological materials drawn up by the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic in cooperation with the Council, allows for the adoption of necessary fiscal measures.  Furthermore, at a time when the contours of economic development are not known for 2020, let alone for the year after, it is not, from the point of view of the Czech Fiscal Council, reasonable to set specific values of structural deficits in the Act.</p>



<p>The Czech Fiscal Council is of the opinion that laws, not only those in the sphere of fiscal rules, should be of universal application and should not, as far as possible, take heed of every specific situation with new sections that apply only to a specific period or one year.  In this context, the Council also deems it inappropriate that the bill amending the Act on Budgetary Responsibility Rules, adherence to which the Council is to oversee, was not consulted with key partners, which include, according to the Act, the Czech Fiscal Council, and they were not even informed of the plan in advance.  Members of the Czech Fiscal Council understand that the present situation requires speed and actionability; however, on the other hand, it is not possible to drive at any cost to adopt, in a legislative emergency regime, changes that are not essential to overcoming the crisis.</p>



<p>Even though the Czech Fiscal Council agrees that, in crisis situations such as this, the response of fiscal policy must be sufficiently massive, it again stresses that the money expended must also be targeted as effectively as possible.  The government does not have unlimited means and individual measures must therefore be targeted to areas where they will either prevent major social problems related, for example, to bankruptcies of companies or sole proprietors or layoffs, or yield a significant positive stimulus for the country’s economy.  No such loosening of fiscal policy is necessary in the coming seven years, even in a situation when the health of the population is a priority.  Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the expanded fiscal space will be used only for expense and income measures related to elimination of the economic consequences of the “coronavirus” crisis and there is a risk that the purpose of budgetary responsibility rules will be defied and room will be opened up without justification for an increase in public sector indebtedness. </p>

<p>The Czech Fiscal Council is keeping a close eye on the constantly
changing situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and on the measures being
adopted in relation to it, not only domestically, but also abroad.&nbsp; We then evaluate that information, in particular
with a view to the possible impact of those measures on the Czech economy and
public finance as a whole.</p>



<p>At present, it is not possible to calculate the impact with sufficient
precision, but it is already evident that extraordinary fiscal measures will be
required to overcome the extraordinary healthcare and economic situation.&nbsp; These will require a change of the 2020 state
budget act.&nbsp; The Council is of the
opinion that the fiscal policy response must be rapid and sufficiently
massive.&nbsp; An advantage of the Czech
Republic in this regard is that, unlike many other EU countries, it is entering
the coming economic crisis with a relatively low level of public debt and hence
has relatively a great deal of room for fiscal stimulus.&nbsp; Also, the institutional set-up of fiscal
policy specified in Act No. 23/2017 Coll., on budgetary responsibility rules,
allows the limit values of public budget deficits to be exceeded in such
specific situations.</p>



<p>In this context, the CFC welcomes that the government of the Czech Republic
has already announced the general framework of direct and indirect support to
entrepreneurs, companies, and individuals.&nbsp;
Given that, even with the expected significant increase of public budget
deficit, the government will not have unlimited funds, all measures must be
targeted into areas where they will either prevent significant social problems
related to, for example, bankruptcies of companies or sole proprietors or to
lay-offs, or where they will bring a significant positive stimulus for the
country’s economy with a high multiplication effect. </p>



<p>Good news for the Czech economy is the scope of the measures announced
by Germany for its economy.&nbsp; The largest
trading partner of the Czech Republic is planning to provide support loans of
up to EUR 550 bn through its state development bank.&nbsp; This step will, in turn, help many Czech
companies for which Germany is a key export partner.&nbsp; The German government may provide support in
this extent to its economy without greater difficulties, among other things
because, in recent years, it has been practicing a procyclical fiscal policy
and created budget surplus.</p>



<p>The Czech Fiscal Council will continue to assess the situation and the
impact of the measures taken in relation to the pandemic, on public finance and
on the economy as a whole, and will inform industry professionals as well as
the general public of its findings.&nbsp;
Naturally, in doing so, it will take account the extraordinary nature of
the situation and of the exceptional nature of the expenses that must help
citizens of the Czech Republic cope, not only with serious medical risks but,
last but not least, with the adverse effects of the pandemic on their
lives.&nbsp; If necessary, the Office of the Czech
Fiscal Council is also prepared to offer its expertise and analytical capacity
for searching for and evaluating other options for supporting the Czech economy
and helping it overcome this difficult situation. </p>

<p><em>Below, you can find commentary of the Chairman of the Czech Fiscal Council, Eva Zamrazilová.  The text was first published in a special supplement of the Banking monthly magazine entitled Top Finance (Bankovnictví, vol. 1/2020).</em></p>



<p> Developments abroad will continue to be essential to the Czech economy in 2020.  In 2019, the global economy was weakened by problems in trade relations that affected global trade.  Added to that was a slow-down in emerging markets and the pending Brexit, which combined resulted in a weakening of domestic demand and overall worsening of sentiments.</p>



<p> That is why global growth in 2019 was the weakest in recent decades, which naturally affected the Czech economy, as well.  A small, open economy, dominantly linked to the EU and Germany, has suffered not only due to slow global growth but also due to developments in the automobile industry, which is a predominant export article for the Czech economy.</p>



<p> In 2020, a further slow-down in the economy’s growth can be expected, to approximately 2%, which will still be a solid result in the European context.  The structure of growth will remain similar to that of 2019, with the predominant influence being end consumption – household consumption, supported by government expenditure.  Even though leading indicators abroad improved slightly at the end of 2019, it is still too early to talk about significantly better outlooks for exports. On the other hand, domestic confidence indicators worsened at the end of the year, and the expectations are weak not only among businesses, but also among consumers.  </p>



<p>Growth in household consumption stagnated in Q3 2019, which in combination with worsening consumer confidence indicates possible increasing risk on the domestic scene.</p>



<p>Despite those risks, consumer demand will continue to be supported by the strong labour market in 2020.  Investment demand will remain weak in 2020, under the influence of cyclical developments and continued uncertainties in combination with relatively high costs, which will, however, be reflected in the continued slow growth in imports.  That is why the contribution of net exports to Czech GDP will be likely be positive in 2020.</p>



<p>Expectations among industrialists at the end of 2019 were the weakest since mid-2013, with the situation in the service and construction sector being somewhat better.  The growth of the economy will therefore again be driven primarily by the service sector, while industry will probably note its third year of relatively weak performance in 2020.<br> The labour market is responding to weakened economic performance with a lag, and at the end of 2019, it is still characterised by a surplus of jobs over the number of job seekers, which continues to generate significant pressures in terms of wage growth.  It is only a matter of time before worse export performance will be reflected in the labour market.  The unemployment rate bottomed out in 2019 and in 2020, and it will gradually climb to over 3%.  Gradually, the surplus of the number of jobs over the number of job applicants will start to reduce, which will weaken wage dynamics.  Nevertheless, wage growth of around 5% can be expected in 2020, but with a significant differentiation among professions.  Inflation will most likely remain above the 2% threshold of the central bank in 2020, over which it has hovered since the end of 2016.  Growth in real wages will therefore be weaker than in the previous few years.  Tightening of monetary policy is not very likely in the context of a decelerating economy.  Fiscal policy will support general consumption through public expense and gradually it will shift to neutral influence in terms of its position in the economic cycle.</p>



<p><em>Eva Zamrazilova &#8211; Chairwoman of the Czech Fiscal Council</em></p>

<p>On Tuesday 4 February, the Ministry of Finance issued <a href="https://www.mfcr.cz/en/statistics/macroeconomic-forecast/2020/macroeconomic-forecast-january-2020-37429">a new macroeconomic prediction</a>.  It expects the country’s real GDP to grow by 2% compared to 2019.  The growth estimate remains unchanged, compared to the previous prediction published in November.  “Our view of the development of the Czech economy has remained principally unchanged.  We estimate that real GDP was up by 2.5% in 2019.  We are also keeping to the prediction of a deceleration of the economy to 2.0% in 2020, due to the weaker dynamism of domestic demand.  In 2021, we are expecting GDP to grow by 2.2%, thanks to a gradual revival abroad,” said the Ministry.</p>



<p> Other parameters of the prediction remained largely unchanged, as well.  A shift by 0.2 percentage points did, however, occur in the estimated consumer price level.  Whereas in November, the Ministry had estimated an average inflation of 2.6% for 2020, it now estimates as much as 2.8%.  “In November 2019, the year-on-year growth in consumer prices popped out of the tolerance band of the 2% inflation target of the Czech National Bank, for the first time since October 2012.  The pro-inflation effects of a positive production gap and the increase in labour unit costs are magnified by administrative measures and growth in food prices.  With the exception of the latter, the impact of the factors should gradually wane in the upcoming period.  That is why a gradual approximation of the inflation level to its target can be expected.  Due to price developments at the end of last year and expected oil prices, we are increasing our prediction of the average inflation level in 2020 to 2.8%, and in 2021 we expect inflation of 2.2%,” wrote the authors of the prediction.</p>



<p> According to the prediction, unemployment should reach 2.2% this year, the volume of wages and salaries should be up by 6.1%.  That is a rate 0.2 percentage points faster than was expected by the November prediction.</p>



<p>As for risks, the Ministry continues to state that they are deflected downwards, in particular with a view to developments abroad.  “Compared to the previous macroeconomic prediction, the intensity of downward risks has decreased,” says the prediction.  The most significant risks it lists include tensions in trade relations between the US and China and the development of sentiment indicators in many eurozone countries.  Given the deadline for data sources for the new prediction, which was on 14 January 2020, with the selected bases being related to 6 January, the prediction was, on the other hand, not able to take into account the potential economic effects of the coronavirus epidemic in China.  They could affect the Czech Republic indirectly, through Germany, for which China is the largest trading partner. </p>

<p>A member of the Czech Fiscal Council Jan Pavel will carry on in office for another six years.  After his re-election by the Chamber of Deputies at the suggestion of the Czech National Bank last October, he was sworn in on Thursday 23 January 2020, by the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Radek Vondráček, and commences his second term in office. </p>



<p><br> The standard term of office of members of the Czech Fiscal Council is six years.  When the Council was established in 2018, the term of two of its three members was shortened, in order that the entire Council would not be replaced every six years, thereby retaining continuity.  Jan Pavel was the first to have his term expire, after two years in office.</p>



<p><br> Professor Pavel is a respected person in academia.  In his academic work, he has devoted many years to public finance, budgetary and fiscal policy theory, as well as efficiency of the functioning of the public sector.  Between 2003 and 2006, he worked at the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic.  Since 2005, he has worked at the University of Economics in Prague, at the Department of Public Finance.  He is an author or co-author of a number of publications, major studies, and articles, both in the Czech Republic and abroad.  He became a professor in 2015 and was first appointed as a Czech Fiscal Council member in January 2018.</p>



<p><br> The Czech Fiscal Council is a specialised independent authority whose main mission is to evaluate whether the State and other public institutions adhere to budgetary responsibility rules set out by <a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2017-23">Act No. 23/2017 Coll</a>.   The Chairman of the Council is elected by the Chamber of Deputies at the suggestion of the government.  The other two members are also elected by the Chamber of Deputies, one at the suggestion of the Senate and the other at the suggestion of the Czech National Bank.</p>

<p>The
Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Committee for Fair Pensions
presented the basic principles of the pension system reform.&nbsp; One of the fundamental building blocks of the
proposal is the splitting of the existing first pension system pillar in two:
the zeroth and the first pillar. </p>



<p>The
zeroth pillar is to ensure pensioners a minimum sum that everyone will receive,
as an equal amount, regardless of the amount of their previous earnings and
payments into the pension system.&nbsp; All
that is required is that the person reach the minimum retirement age and meet
the qualifying duration of insurance.&nbsp;
This pillar is to be financed from tax income of the state budget.</p>



<p>The
first pillar will operate on a principle similar to that today – it will take
into account a person’s previous work career.&nbsp;
Its financing is to be ensured from social security premium payments.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.mpsv.cz/documents/20142/1248138/10_01_2020+TZ+-+Ministryně+Maláčová+představila+tři+varianty+důchodové+reformy.pdf/1a323655-200c-affb-3558-048fa1794c35">MLSA press release</a> indicates that the first pillar also recognises care for children, in the form of a bonus.&nbsp; Another instrument that the reform will introduce will be so-called fictitious assessment income.&nbsp; They will be used to factor into a care giver’s pension insurance his or her last income or average wage in the economy (whichever is more advantageous for the care giver).</p>



<p><strong>Scheme of the new functioning of the pension systém:</strong></p>

<p>The variant referred to as economical expects the basic pension to amount to CZK 7,740 and net expenses on the pension system to drop.&nbsp; The technical variant, in which the minimum pension would presently amount to CZK 10,500 and drop to CZK 8,710 by 2070, plans on an initial drop in net expenditure on the pension system.&nbsp; In 2040, however, net expenditure in this variant would be up by 0.3%, compared to the situation if the current condition were maintained.</p>



<p>The third variant, referred to as fair, also plans on a basic pension of CZK 10,500, but unlike in the technical variant, the compensatory ratio of the component should not decline.&nbsp; Net pension expenses would, in that case, increase by 0.2% GDP in year one, and by 2040, it would be up to 1.3% of GDP.&nbsp; The fair variant also plans on a bonus of CZK 240 for every year of work beyond the age of 41 years.&nbsp; The present state corresponds to a bonus of CZK 170. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Pension expenditures in the Czech Republic are the eighth lowest in the EU, in relation to gross domestic product.&nbsp; Whereas the EU28 states expended an average of 9.2% of GDP on pensions in 2017, it was only 6.9% in this country.&nbsp; In discussions about pension system change, opinions can be heard, based on this data, that the problem of the long-term sustainability of the Czech pension system, and in turn all public finance is not fundamental, when seen in an international comparison. </p>



<p>But as shown by a new information study ‘International Comparison of Public
Expenditure on the Pension System’ drawn up by the Office of the Czech Fiscal
Council, that is an excessively simplified view.&nbsp; “A simple international comparison of pension
expenditures is greatly distorted.&nbsp;
Countries differ in a number of parameters that have an impact on the
volume of public pension expenditures.&nbsp;
The fact that a country expend a greater share of its GDP on pensions
than the Czech Republic need not mean that there is significant space for
increasing public expenditure on pensions in the Czech Republic,” says one of
the study’s authors, Chief Analyst of the Office of the National Fiscal Council
Michal Hlaváček, pointing, for example, to the fact that the Czech Republic is
one of the few countries in the EU28 where, with rare exceptions, no taxes or
social security are collected from pensions.&nbsp;
</p>



<p>The amount of public expenditure on pensions is also influenced by other
factors, some of which are not at all influenced by political decisions.&nbsp; An example is the demographic structure of
the population.&nbsp; In countries that have
advanced to a later stage of population ageing than the Czech Republic, old-age
pensioners represent a greater share in the overall population.&nbsp; Higher pension expenditures in proportion to
GDP can therefore be expected in such countries.</p>



<p>This data indicates that a simple comparison of gross pension
expenditure is misleading and that it cannot be concluded that the pension
system in the Czech Republic is underfinanced compared to other countries, on
the basis of that comparison.&nbsp; Comparable
data could only be obtained by simulating the amount of pension expenditure in
individual EU countries, if pensions were not taxed in any of the countries, and
if the countries had identical demographic structures, the same compensation
ratio, and the same share of worker compensation in GDP.</p>



<p>The Office of the Czech Fiscal Council did conduct such a simulation in
its information study.&nbsp; The resulting
data shows that, once cleansed of the ageing of the population, taxation, and
worker compensation in GDP, the amounts of expenditures on pensions in the
Czech Republic is average, as compared to other EU states and does not deviate
in any way.&nbsp; In the case of countries
with significantly higher gross expenditures on pensions than in the Czech
Republic (France, Austria, Portugal, Italy), the difference between them and
the Czech Republic drops from an average of 5.2 p.p. to 2.6 p.p. when cleansed,
i.e., by half.&nbsp; After cleansing, some
countries that reported higher gross pension expenditures than the Czech
Republic report a lower share of expenditures on pensions than the Czech
Republic.&nbsp; These include Sweden, Denmark,
Germany, and the United Kingdom.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Overall, higher gross
expenditures on pensions, as compared to those in the Czech Republic, are, in
the vast majority of countries, explicable by their taxation, older population,
and a higher share of worker compensation.&nbsp;
Given the expected ageing of the population and with increased economic
convergence in the Czech Republic, the share of gross expenditures on pension
in GDP will gradually increase towards values customary in those
countries.&nbsp; “Lower gross pension
expenditures in the Czech Republic therefore cannot serve as a relevant
argument for stating that there is significant room in the Czech Republic for
increasing public expenditure on pensions, for example, in the form of greater
increases in the compensation ratio or reduction of retirement age,” says
Hlaváček in commenting on the findings of the study.</p>
